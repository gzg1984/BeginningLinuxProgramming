MYAPP(1)                                                              MYAPP(1)



NNAAMMEE
       Myapp - A simple demonstration application that does very little.


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       mmyyaapppp [-option ...]


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _m_y_a_p_p is a complete application that does nothing useful.


       It was written for demonstration purposes.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       It doesn't have any, but lets pretend, to make this template complete:


       --ooppttiioonn
              If there was an option, it would not be -option.


RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
       myapp uses almost no resources.


DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       The  program  shouldn't  output  anything,  so  if you find it doing so
       there's probably something wrong. The return value is zero.


SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       The only other program we know with this this little  functionality  is
       the ubiquitous hello world application.

       There probably are some, but we don't know what they are yet.
