@.TH MYAPP 1

.SH NAME
Myapp \- A simple demonstration application that does very little.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B myapp 
[\-option ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
\fImyapp\fP is a complete application that does nothing useful.

.PP
It was written for demonstration purposes.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
It doesn't have any, but lets pretend, to make this template complete:

.TP
.BI \-option 
If there was an option, it would not be -option.

.SH RESOURCES
.PP
myapp uses almost no resources.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The program shouldn't output anything, so if you find it doing so there's
probably something wrong. The return value is zero.

.SH SEE ALSO
The only other program we know with this this little functionality is the
ubiquitous hello world application.
